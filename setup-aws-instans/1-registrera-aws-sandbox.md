## Cloud sandbox account cleanup
As a reminder, "Sandbox" cloud environments are not meant for long term development purposes. Automated cleanup is enforced in on all Sandbox environments to ensure that there are not unnecessary costs accumulated.
If you are using cloud capacity in Knowit operated cloud environments which are named as "Sandbox" environments, be aware that those are not meant for long term development purposes - rather just trying out things quickly.
As there have been forgotten resources in these accounts, weekly automated cleanup is enforced on all Sandbox environments to ensure that no unnecessary costs are accumulated.
Accounts will be emptied of any resources weekly on Sunday evenings. There are no backups taken before the cleanup and there are no means to restore the cleaned up capacity.
